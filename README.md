# Cultivator's Web Page
A project made for the Web Development Bootcamp at Coding Dojo.

A web page for cultivadors and consumers, in which you can upload your latets crops, comment in other farmer's crops,
put your products in our market. Consumers can add those products to the shopping cart and complete their purchase

This project started as a group assignment but I intend to update it quite a bit.
